                    <p>While some people don’t think that <a href="#">face primer</a> is necessary, I personally view it
                        as a vital step in my makeup routine.</p>
                    <p>Face primers’ exact effects on your skin and makeup can vary, but overall, their main purpose is
                        to keep your skin looking smooth and your makeup looking fresh all day long.</p>

                    <h2>Html5 Video Player</h2>
                    <p>Foundation is probably the hardest part of your makeup routine to get right, as you not only have
                        to consider the type of coverage you want (i.e. sheer/natural, medium, or full), but also your
                        skin type and undertones.</p>
                    <p>If you are new to wearing foundation or aren’t sure what type/shade is right for you, I’d highly
                        recommend going to your nearest Sephora, MAC, or department store and have a makeup artist help
                        you pick out one that matches your complexion and fits your coverage needs. It’s also a good
                        idea to request a sample if you want to see how a formula feels on your skin before buying.</p>

                    <h2>PDF Poster</h2>
                    <p>Personally, I prefer BB cream to regular foundation, as I find it to be much more
                        natural-looking. It is a great option if you’re looking for something that has skincare benefits
                        such as moisturizing or priming (some BB creams have primer built in).</p>
                    <p>In addition, if you are new to the makeup world, a good BB cream is an even better place to start
                        than foundation, as it feels lighter on the skin, is hard to overdo, and can be applied with
                        your fingers.</p>

                    <p>If you have acne, dark circles, or any kind of discoloration, concealer is a must-have.</p>
                    <p>Concealers come in full-coverage and sheerer-coverage formulations, and which one you should
                        choose depends on how much you’re trying to cover up.</p>
                    <p>When choosing a concealer for acne and/or discoloration, find a shade that is as close as
                        possible to your foundation/BB cream shade for the most natural look.</p>
