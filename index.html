                                    <p>Foundation is probably the hardest part
                                        of your makeup routine to get right, as
                                        you
                                        not
                                        only
                                        have
                                        to consider the type of coverage you
                                        want (i.e. sheer/natural, medium, or
                                        full), but
                                        also
                                        your

                                        recommend going to your nearest Sephora,
                                        MAC, or department store and have a
                                        makeup
                                        artist

                                        you pick out one that matches your
                                        complexion and fits your coverage needs.
                                        It’s
                                        also a
                                        good
                                        idea to request a sample if you want to
                                        see how a formula feels on your skin
                                        before
                                        buying.
